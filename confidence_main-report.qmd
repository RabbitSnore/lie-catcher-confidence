# Hypothesis 1: General Confidence-Accuracy Relationship

*Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate.*

```{r}
summary(glmer_h1)
```

# Hypothesis 2: Signal-Present Judgment Specificity

*Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate, to a greater extent for lie judgments than truth
judgments.*

```{r}
lrt_h2
```

```{r}
summary(glmer_h2_base)
```

```{r}
summary(glmer_h2_interaction)
```

# Hypothesis 3: Variation Across Senders: 

*Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate, possibly to a greater extent for lie judgments than
truth judgments, and this tendency varies in magnitude across senders.*

# Hypothesis 4: Variation Across Contexts

*Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate, possibly to a greater extent for lie judgments than
truth judgments, and this tendency varies in magnitude across contexts.*

# Hypothesis 5: Variation Across Receivers

*Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate, possibly to a greater extent for lie judgments than
truth judgments, and this tendency varies in magnitude across receivers.*

```{r}
lrt_h5
```

```{r}

# Hypothesis 6: Detectable Context Specificity: 

Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate, to a greater extent for lie judgments than truth
judgments, specifically in situations in which judgments tend to be more
accurate.

# Hypothesis 7: Detectable Sender Specificity

*Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate, to a greater extent for lie judgments than truth
judgments, specifically for more detectable senders.*

# Hypothesis 8: Capable Receiver Specificity

*Confidence predicts deception detection accuracy, such that more confident
judgments are more accurate, to a greater extent for lie judgments than truth
judgments, specifically for receivers who tend to be more accurate.*
